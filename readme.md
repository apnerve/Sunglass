**A mixin and functions library for Sass**

## Note

The current version does not work in Node-Sass, sorry! I'm working on [4.0](https://github.com/devatrox/Sunglass/tree/4.0) which is a complete overhaul and should be coming out in the next few weeks.

## Requirements
Sass 3.3+

## Installation

* Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/)

    `bower install sunglass --save-dev`

* Or Download the [latest release](https://github.com/devatrox/Sunglass/releases) and put it wherever you like

* Import Sunglass into your Sass file

    `@import "path/to/sunglass";`

* Change settings before the `@import` statement (optional)
    ```` sass
    $sunglass: (
      base-gap: 30px,
      base-font-size: 18px
    );
    ````


I will create a detailed documentation later on. Until then, head over to the [makeshift docs](docs.md)
