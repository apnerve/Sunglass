**A mixin and functions library for Sass**

## Requirements
Sass 3.3+

## Installation

* Install with [Bower](http://bower.io/)

    `bower install sunglass --save-dev`

* Or Download the [latest release](https://github.com/devatrox/Sunglass/releases) and put it wherever you like

* Import Sunglass into your Sass file

    `@import "path/to/sunglass";`


I will create a detailed documentation later on. Until then, head over to the [makeshift docs](docs.md)
